"""
If the possible benefits (e.g., better performance) are larger than the possible negative
effects (e.g., affected maintainability), the real-world coding problems may find an excuse 
for making an exception to the rules. Practicality then becomes more important than purity.

If you need to write an 85-character long line of code because splitting it into two 
separate lines affects readability, do it. If you need to keep compatibility with previously
written code and use CamelCase instead of snake_case, do it. Rules sometimes have to be broken, exceptions have to be made.
